# COVID-19 Conspiracy Analysis (China)

Exploring American beliefs in the COVID-19 conspiracy theory – Coronavirus is a Chinese bioweapon; inference model through logistic regression; testing various multiclass classification algorithms for predicting the degree of beliefs in the conspiracy.

## Description

The COVID-19 pandemic has had many conspiracy theories surrounding the origin of the virus. One of which says that the Chinese government developed the virus as a bioweapon. Previously, to answer questions related to exploring American beliefs in this conspiracy, a survey was conducted in the year 2020 by Stecula and Pickup in their research. I have used the same data set to provide solutions to two tasks:

1. Find out if any individual type of American believes in the mentioned conspiracy more than the other type. (inference model)

3. Build a suitable prediction model to predict any specific American’s degree of belief in the conspiracy theory. (prediction model)

This analysis was done as part of the ```Statistical Learning``` course held at Dalarna University for the master in the data science program. 

## Getting Started

### Usage

The analysis is presented in ```ConspiracyAnalysisReport.pdf``` and the two models for analysis in ```inference_model.R``` and ```prediction_model.R```.  The code is in R; hence, R and optional tools like RStudio are required to run the code. In addition, the images used in the report are present separately for easy access to the information.

However, this repository does not provide the data used for analysis.
